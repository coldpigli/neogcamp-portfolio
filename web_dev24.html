        <h1>How I met NeoGcamp?</h1>
        <h3>-by Piyush Das</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Piyush Das. Let me introduce myself before I tell you my story. I am a fresh graduate working for Tata Consultancy Services on weekdays. On weekends, I'm a musician, a learner and/or a sloth X'D.  </p>
        
        <p>I came to know about Tanay Pratap in the most organic way. I was recently put into a new project which required me to explore web-dev with ReactJS. I was spending countless hours going through tutorials and any other means I could come across. Then, I happened to come across a talk by Tanay Pratap on Youtube on GrpahQL. I liked it so I followed him on LinkedIn. That's when I got to know about NeoGcamp and it has turned my life around. From hating web-development for most part of my engineering days to dedicating all my free time to learn more about it, it wouldn't have been possible without Tanay and NeoGcamp and I couldn't have been more grateful. Suddenly, I feel the universe has a plan for me and that plan feels to be in motion now. A butterfly flaps its wings and it starts to rain. I have my wings stretched and I will not rest until I fly. </p> 

        <p>And hence, I'm working hard. I am proud of myself for having completed Level 0 while doing a full time job. I had to start from scratch. But in the end it was all worth it. I think the next challenge would be to continue this, maintain consistency. I wish that I get through to level1 but I also know that it's not the end of the world if I don't. The learning will continue regardless. Thank you for instilling the idea of not giving up in me. I will always be grateful to the team. </p>

        <p>If you're reading this I would love to connect with you, discuss anything and everything under the sky. I like talking to people. Find my socials below. </p>
