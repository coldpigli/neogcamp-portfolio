        <h1>Why should you write Accessible code ?</h1>
        <h3>-by Piyush Das</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Piyush Das. Let me introduce myself before I tell you my story. I am a fresh graduate working for Tata Consultancy Services on weekdays. On weekends, I'm a musician, a learner and/or a sloth X'D.  </p>
        
        <p>Accessibility on web has been an important but mostly ignored topic for entry level engineers. Accessibility on web means to write code in a way which allows specially-abled people to go through and use your website without any hiccups. Technology shouldn't be a barrier but an enabler. Thankfully a lot of developers have started taking it seriously and even corporations are taking care to provide Knowledge transitions for developers in this subject.</p> 

        <p>Let's see the major ways in which you can make your websites more accessible.
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Add images with alt-text</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Allow users to enlarge font-sizes</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Keep contrast sensitivity in mind</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add keyboard navigation</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Make audio and video accessible</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Minimise use of tables as it is challenging for screenreaders.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Research about the people who are going to be using your website.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use Semantic HTML</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
        </p>

        <p>In the end, I would like to conclude by saying that we shouldn't only be focused on building great products. We should also focus on making our products more inclusive. This is of extreme importance now more than ever because everything is moving to web and we don't wanna leave people behind. Let us all move towards a better future together where one does not feel left out. </p>
